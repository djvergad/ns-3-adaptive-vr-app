/**
 * \ingroup burstsink
 *
 * \brief Receives and consume traffic generated from a BurstyApplication
 * to an IP address and port
 *
 * This application was based on PacketSink, and modified to accept traffic
 * generated by BurstyApplication.
 * The application assumes to be on top of a UDP socket, thus receiving UDP
 * datagrams rather than bytestreams.
 *
 * The sink tries to aggregate single packets (fragments) into a single packet
 * burst. To do so, it gathers information from SeqTsSizeFragHeader, which all
 * received packets should have.
 * It then makes the following assumptions:
 * - Being based on a UDP socket, packets might arrive out-of-order. Within a
 * burst, BurstSink will reorder the received packets.
 * - While receiving burst n, if a fragment from burst k<n is received, the
 * fragment is discarded
 * - While receiving burst n, if a fragment from burst k>n is received,
 * burst n is discarded and burst k will start being buffered.
 * - If all fragments from a burst are received, the burst is successfully
 * received.
 *
 * Traces are sent when a fragment is received and when a whole burst is
 * successfully received.
